# Quran-Sentiment-Analysis

**Context**

The Holy Quran is the central text for 1.5 billion Muslims around the world. It literally means "The Recitation." It is undoubtedly the finest work in Arabic literature and revealed by Allah (God) to His Messenger Prophet Muhammed (Peace Be Upon Him) through angel Gabriel. It was revealed verbally from December 22, 609 (AD) to 632 AD (when Prophet Muhammed (Peace Be Upon Him) died)

The book is divided into 30 parts, 114 Chapters and 6,000+ verses.

There has been a lot of questions and comments on the text of this holy book given the contemporary Geo-political situation of the world, wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan and the ongoing terrorism.


**Inspiration**

Here are some ideas to explore:

Can we make a word cloud for each chapter

Can we make a word cloud of the whole book and find out the frequency of each word

Can we describe or annotate subjects in each chapter and verse

Can we find how many times The Quran has mentioned Humans, Women, Humility, Heaven or Hell

Can we compare the text with other famous books and see the correlation

Can we compare the text with laws in multiple countries to see the resemblance

Any other ideas you can think of

I am looking forward to see your work and ideas and will keep adding more ideas to explore
